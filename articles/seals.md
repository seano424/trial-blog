WASHINGTON (AFP) – Fat elephant seals prioritise hiding themselves from predators during their vast, months-long foraging expeditions in the open ocean, while skinny seals need to take more risks until they’re nice and plump, a study showed on Wednesday.

The paper, published in the journal Science Advances, is the first to continuously measure changes in behaviour relative to body fat, proving decades-old ecological theories about how wild animals balance perils against payoffs.

First author Roxanne Beltran, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, told AFP she had long been fascinated by elephant seals, which assemble on California’s beaches in winter to breed, give birth, nurse their young and molt before embarking on their summer journey across the North Pacific Ocean.

“It’s difficult for us to wrap our minds around what these animals endure during the seven months, 10,000-kilometre migrations because it’s so fundamentally different from what we do,” said Beltran.

Despite appearances, the sea mammals are tremendous athletes.
