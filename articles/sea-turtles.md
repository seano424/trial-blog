Marine science has its own crop circle mysteries. Sea turtles, sharks, penguins and even whales sometimes just go circular, swimming around and around in a loop or spiral. The puzzles are not whodunits so much as whydoits.

“I doubted my eyes when I first saw the data,” says marine biologist Tomoko Narazaki of the University of Tokyo. A green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) she and colleagues tagged near an African island with good places for laying eggs made a total of 26 circles. The turtle turning and turning underwater swam “like a machine,” Narazaki says.

When Narazaki got home and enthused to her institute colleagues, she found that they had recorded circling or spiraling bouts now and then in other marine animals.  Going back more than a decade, 3-D data-logging devices fastened on 10 sea species as diverse as king penguins and a Cuvier’s beaked whale had picked up enough detail to reconstruct the animals’ circles and squiggles, Narazaki and colleagues report March 18 in iScience.

It’s easy to imagine what’s going on with some of the swimmers: Tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) looping around during the deep phase of their plunges to depths near the Hawaiian Islands are probably circling in search of prey.  Other researchers have found humpback whales whooshing around creating circular death traps of bubbles that keep prey in a dense, gulpable mass (SN: 11/9/19). But some acrobatics get more mysterious.

The green sea turtle that amazed Narazaki was circling steadily — no lunges or exploratory side-loopings —so the researchers doubt the animal was looking for food. Narazaki saw this behavior while tracking a turtle that researchers had moved off-course on its way to lay eggs. The turtle didn’t swim bouts of repeated circles until near the inviting island. That circling may have had something to do with getting a good read on an important location, perhaps checking the geomagnetic field, the researchers propose. They note that submarines also circle as they take geomagnetic data.
