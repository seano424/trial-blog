A new study conducted by the University of Bristol has found crocodiles underwent snappy evolution making them flourish on land and in the oceans. While modern crocodiles are predators living in rivers, lakes and wetlands preying on fish, reptiles and birds, a new research published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Societyreveals ancient crocodiles were much more varied because of rapid evolution. The mystery behind –why did the crocodiles survive the asteroid strike that wiped out dinosaurs 66 million years ago — is believed to be solved with this study, stating that some crocodiles were adapted to living in oceans like dolphins and others lived on the land as fast-moving plant-eaters.

Researchers from the University of Bristol and Harvard University studied over 200 skulls and jaws, as well as fossils from the 230-million-year history of crocodiles and their extinct relatives. Shape variations of the skulls and jaws among different species were studied to analyse how fast crocodile groups changed with time.
